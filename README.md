## C Language Code Collection

This repository is a comprehensive collection of C language programs, organized by topic, day, and project. It features a wide range of code examples, from basic syntax and control structures to advanced concepts like file handling, pointers, and custom algorithms. The folder structure is designed for easy navigation, with each directory representing a different day, topic, or project, making it simple to find and review specific types of programs.

Inside, you'll find hundreds of C files covering practical exercises, custom pattern generation, mini-projects, and real-world problem-solving tasks. Each folder (such as `day10`, `day11`, etc.) contains multiple tasks that build on core programming concepts, while project folders offer more complex challenges to deepen your understanding. This structure supports both step-by-step learning and targeted practice for specific topics.

Whether you're a student, self-learner, or preparing for technical interviews, this repository provides valuable resources to strengthen your C programming skills. Explore the code, experiment with modifications, and use these examples as a foundation for your own projects. Happy coding!
